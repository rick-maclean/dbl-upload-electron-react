Place your XML statement file from Wycliffe in this directory. 
Drag it on top of the DragXMLOntoMe1.bat (or the ...2orMore.bat)

The XML files will be processes by the saxon XSLT Home Edition (http://saxon.sourceforge.net/#F9.7HE) engine and a TNTmpd file will be output into TNTOutputs. This file can be double-clicked to open directly into TNT Connect software. 

Saxon may require Java SDK to be installed. I can't remember at this point. 

I believe the XSL file is currently coded for my account number:
xsl:for-each select="wbtc:transaction[@tranType='donation' and wbtc:glAcct!='3-5031']">

This will need to be edited 3-5031 for other people's use I think. I am not what 3-5031 represents.
